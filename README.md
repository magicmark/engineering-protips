### Limit the amount of logic on a single line of code

TODO: Add rationale

### Limit the amount of logic in a try/catch block

Keep the contents of try/catch blocks to a minimum.

#### Example**:

**Instead of**:

```js
try {
  const config = yaml.safeLoad(fs.readFileSync(path.join(process.cwd(), configFile), 'utf8'));
  const { projectName, scanPaths } = config;
  const resolvedScanPaths = [];
  scanPaths.forEach(scanPath => {
    resolvedScanPaths.push(path.join(__dirname, scanPath));
  });
  ...
  ...
  27 lines later
  ...
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Could not read config file, assuming defaults.');
}
```

Prefer:

```js
let config;

try {
  config = fs.readFileSync(path.join(process.cwd(), configFile), 'utf8'));
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Could not read config file, assuming defaults.');
}
```

**Why?**

There's _lots_ of things could throw inside our original try block. We may accidentally silence and ignore unrelated errors.

(e.g. Maybe the config file _was_ found, but `scanPaths` wasn't specified - so `scanPaths.forEach` throws, but we silenced it! Uh oh!)

### Limit what you catch


Keeping the contents of the try block minimal means we avoid a giant "catch all" that silences errors we didn't mean to catch.

(lots of things could throw!)

I'd just wrap L64.
